- Worked to build a web application called [Sunstone](https://sunstone.in/) – an online learning application for students.

- Increased clients’ earnings by 30 to 40% by implementing “click to chat” and “click to call” features easily accessible to the users on the homepage.

- Reduced time and manual effort by expeditiously implementing redux for a new login, reframing google-login architecture, connecting client-side endpoints and creating effective redirects and routes using MongoDB.
